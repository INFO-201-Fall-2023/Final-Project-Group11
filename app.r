                       population. In recent years, the awareness of mental health has risen tremendously, and advocating for people to seek 
                       professional help has been more accepted by mainstream culture. In addition, smoking is a widespread habit that affects
                       the lives of millions of people, and its impact on mental health is often overlooked. By exploring this topic, we can 
                       shed light on the issues. Moreover, the impact of employment status and/or education level on smoking and mental health 
                       can highlight the larger issue of socioeconomic inequality. Within the context of the ongoing pandemic, the relationship
                       between smoking and mental health has become even more pertinent. Stress and anxiety levels have been on the rise, which
                       has led people to turn to smoking as a coping mechanism. This can then lead to an increased need for mental health 
                       support, especially for those in lower socioeconomic brackets who may have more limited resources."),

                       to look at because it can show what issues are causing young adults to engage in these harmful behaviors, 
                       and is it because of the lack of mental health care that is causing this. Analyzing this data can help us understand 
                       the correlation between mental health issues and tobacco use. Another question that can be asked is how the rates of
                       young adults using these products changed over time. This is another important question to think about because it can 
                       show what significant cultural and historical changes have affected the rate of mental health in young adults to turn
                       to tobacco use. (Ex. COVID). Another question that is worth asking is how the different states responded to this crisis.
                       This is important to look at, as it can give insight on what solutions are working to combat this issue and what areas 
                       are experiencing this problem at unprecedented levels. With this information, it can give lawmakers a general overview 
                       of this issue and make them aware of what solutions are working, by comparing the data from other states and seeing 
                       what solutions have worked and what have not."),
