# Final Project - Project Proposal (INFO 201 A)
**Group 11: Elizabeth Williams, Soha Sultana, and Brittney Oeur**

## Story Pitch:
The story our group intends to tell is about the relationship between tobacco use, employment status and/or education level, and mental health. Such as how the use of tobacco/smoking, the status of someone’s employment and/or education level may have an impact on their mental health.

We believe this an interesting and compelling story because it touches on a topic that affects a large portion of the population. In recent years, the awareness of mental health has risen tremendously, and advocating for people to seek professional help has been more accepted by mainstream culture. In addition, smoking is a widespread habit that affects the lives of millions of people, and its impact on mental health is often overlooked. By exploring this topic, we can shed light on the issues. Moreover, the impact of employment status and/or education level on smoking and mental health can highlight the larger issue of socioeconomic inequality. Within the context of the ongoing pandemic, the relationship between smoking and mental health has become even more pertinent. Stress and anxiety levels have been on the rise, which has led people to turn to smoking as a coping mechanism. This can then lead to an increased need for mental health support, especially for those in lower socioeconomic brackets who may have more limited resources.

Some of the data we plan to look at includes causes of smoking in young adults, and the rates of this over time and what treatment options have been presented across the country. These pieces of data are important to look at because it can show what issues are causing young adults to engage in these harmful behaviors, and is it because of the lack of mental health care that is causing this. Analyzing this data can help us understand the correlation between mental health issues and tobacco use. Another question that can be asked is how the rates of young adults using these products changed over time. This is another important question to think about because it can show what significant cultural and historical changes have affected the rate of mental health in young adults to turn to tobacco use. (Ex. COVID). Another question that is worth asking is how the different states responded to this crisis. This is important to look at, as it can give insight on what solutions are working to combat this issue and what areas are experiencing this problem at unprecedented levels. With this information, it can give lawmakers a general overview of this issue and make them aware of what solutions are working, by comparing the data from other states and seeing what solutions have worked and what have not.

Overall, this story is relevant and timely, given the pandemic and the extensive impact it has had on mental health. It is also a topic that affects a large portion of the population and is therefore of interest to many communities. By exploring the relationship between smoking, employment status, education level, and mental health, we can better understand the complex interplay between these factors.

## Background Research/Inspiration
**1) [Do people with mental illness and substance use disorders use tobacco more often?](https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/tobacco-nicotine-e-cigarettes/do-people-mental-illness-substance-use-disorders-use-tobacco-more-often#:~:text=Rates%20of%20smoking%20among%20people%20with%20mental%20illness,for%20non-Hispanic%20American%20Indian%20or%20Alaska%20Native%20adults.)**
- “Rates of smoking among people with mental illness were highest for young adults, those with low levels of education, and those living below the poverty level”. 
- According to the 2022 Monitoring the Future Survey, 4% of 12th graders, 1.7% of 10th graders, and 0.8% of 8th graders used cigarettes in the past month.12 An analysis of the 2022 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) found that 11.3% of middle and high school students reported using a tobacco product in the last 30 days, with higher rates among young people experiencing high levels of psychological distress. Young people whose guardians earned lower wages and young people from marginalized communities, such as lesbian, gay and bisexual young people and transgender young people, reported higher smoking rates

**2) [Youth and Tobacco Use](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/youth_data/tobacco_use/index.htm)**
- Youth tobacco use is the best indicator of how smoking behavior is likely to go in the future and how it is likely to impact future generations
- Data from both middle and high school students
- We likely will include how new smoking technology changed patterns that suggested smoking and nicotine use was on a downward trend

**3) [Access to Care Data 2022](https://mhanational.org/issues/2022/mental-health-america-access-care-data)**
- This website shows a ranking of the availability of mental health care across the states 
- The data itself includes 9 measures that represent; the measures for youth include: Youth with MDE who did not Receive mental health services and Youth with Severe MDE who received Some Consistent Treatment
- We can use this data to get an idea of how different states play into the issue of mental health and tobacco use, and how they are combating it. This is helpful for comparisons and trends across states and getting an idea on what are the most practical and beneficial ways for mental health care 

**4) [The State Of Mental Health In America](https://mhanational.org/issues/state-mental-health-america)**
- Ranks states’ mental health education and treatment availability for various groups of people (ie kids, uninsured adults, disabled adults, etc)
- The website is a good example of how to organize large volume of data; it emphasizes topics of interest for our group project
- This is more along the lines of inspiration for interactive visualization of geographic data and trends

**5) [Smoking Disparities by Level of Educational Attainment and Birth Cohort in the U.S.](https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(22)00450-0/fulltext#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20in%202018%2C%20current,with%20an%20undergraduate%20college%20degree.)**
- Demonstrates relationship between education level and smoking and how this has changed from 1966 to 2018
- Highlights relevant decrease across the board
- Widening gap between smoking habits in different socioeconomic groups

**6) [Serving Rural America](https://www.ruralminds.org/serving-rural-america?gclid=Cj0KCQjwi46iBhDyARIsAE3nVrYiy5g0vKtTyjymIVEFk1Minw6pVa59F80fprrrqYaZ-rjZvSJNodcaAkU2EALw_wcB)**
- Highlights changes in mental health in rural communities over the pandemic which is something we are also interested in looking into for our project
- Rural communities generally have significantly less access to mental health care but not lower instance of mental health issues
  - This is an important point and discrepancy that exists across America
